## Hey there! 

This is **Warrior Deere** who's mainly working as a farmer somewhere in Europe and loves to code in their freetime.

Especially I am working with TypeScript and I love to create web and desktop applications with NextJS and/or Tauri.
I am currently jumping back and forth between 3 to 4 projects and developing them bit by bit. Some of them are public - my biggest project so far is still unpublished, but it seems that after almost a year of development a first preview version is on its way. So far I've only had negative experiences with announcing release dates, unfortunately something always comes up unexpectedly and ruins my plans - that's why I won't set an exact date this time.
